## Philosophy

World Orogen is concept art for planets. It's built for the moment early in a project when you need a world that *looks* real — believable tectonics, organic coastlines, climate patterns that feel right — but you don't need a geophysical simulation to get there. The science isn't decoration: plate collision models inspired by real tectonics, pressure-driven wind patterns, and Köppen classification are what make the output feel convincing at a glance. If a climate scientist squints and finds inaccuracies, that's fine — but the scientific foundation is what earns the first glance. Plausibility, not precision.

The core value is creative velocity. Generate a planet in seconds, tweak plates and terrain until it matches your vision, then export high-resolution maps into whatever comes next — Gaea, Wonderdraft, Photoshop, a game engine, a novel outline. Orogen is designed to be the fastest path from a blank page to a world worth building on — the first tool in your worldbuilding pipeline, not the last.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Artistic appeal** — Visually interesting, scientifically informed output. Aesthetics come first.
2. **Ease of use and efficiency** — Approachable interface, fast generation. Don't sacrifice usability for realism.
3. **Scientific plausibility** — Grounded in real planetary science. Believable, not necessarily physically accurate.

All three are considered together; ties are broken in the order above.

## Features

- **Fibonacci sphere meshing** with Voronoi cell tessellation via Delaunay triangulation
- **Tectonic plate simulation** — farthest-point seed placement with top-3 jitter, round-robin flood fill with directional growth bias, growth-rate governor, compactness penalty to prevent spindly shapes, multi-pass boundary smoothing, and fragment reconnection
- **Ocean/land assignment** — farthest-point continent seeding, round-robin growth with separation guarantees, trapped sea absorption, targeting ~30% land coverage
- **Collision detection** — convergent, divergent, and transform boundary classification with density-based subduction modeling; dual-layer super plate system groups same-type plates into ~20 tectonic units for broad orogenic belts blended 50/50 with fine-grained individual plate orogeny
- **Elevation generation** — three distance fields (mountain/ocean/coastline) combined via harmonic-mean formula, stress-driven uplift, asymmetric mountain profiles, continental shelf/slope/abyss profiles, foreland basins, plateau formation, and rift valleys with graben profiles
- **Ocean floor features** — mid-ocean ridges at divergent boundaries, deep trenches at subduction zones, fracture zones at transform boundaries, back-arc basins behind subduction zones
- **Island arcs** — volcanic island chains at ocean-ocean convergent boundaries with ridged noise shaping
- **Hotspot volcanism** — dual-component mantle plume model (broad thermal swell + volcanic peak) with drift-trail island chains, domain-warped shape distortion, drift-direction elongation, summit calderas on active domes, radial rift-zone ridges, age-dependent volcanic texture, and per-hotspot variation in strength/decay/spacing
- **Terrain post-processing** — noise-based domain warping (FBM simplex noise with greedy mesh walk) to deform the elevation field for organic coastlines and mountain ridges, independently controllable bilateral smoothing to blend harsh BFS distance-field boundaries, glacial erosion that carves fjords, U-shaped valleys, and lake basins at high latitudes and altitudes via latitude-driven ice flow with drainage accumulation, priority-flood pit resolution with canyon carving (Barnes et al. algorithm that ensures every land cell drains to the ocean, carving dramatic canyons through mountain saddle points rather than filling basins), iterative implicit stream power hydraulic erosion (Braun-Willett style) that carves self-reinforcing river valleys with automatic sediment deposition in flat receivers, thermal erosion that softens ridges via talus-angle material transport, ridge sharpening that accentuates mountain ridgelines, and always-on soil creep (Laplacian diffusion) that rounds off hillslopes
- **Coastal roughening** — fractal noise with active/passive margin differentiation, domain warping for bays/headlands, and offshore island scattering
- **3D globe rendering** with atmosphere rim shader, translucent water sphere, terrain displacement, and starfield
- **Equirectangular map projection** with antimeridian wrapping
- **Interactive editing** — Ctrl-click plates to mark them for reshaping (multi-select with visual tinting), then click Rebuild to apply all changes at once. Ctrl-click again to undo a pending selection. Press Escape to cancel all pending edits
- **Seasonal wind simulation** — pressure-driven wind patterns with a longitude-varying ITCZ that tracks the thermal equator (~5° over ocean, up to 15-20° over continents), Gaussian pressure bands (subtropical highs, subpolar lows, polar highs), land/sea thermal contrast for monsoon-like pressure reversals, elevation barometric effects, and Coriolis-deflected geostrophic wind with natural cross-equatorial flow reversal. Computed for both summer and winter seasons.
- **Ocean surface currents** — rule-based geographic gyre simulation driven by wind belts (trade winds, westerlies, polar easterlies) with a longitude-varying ITCZ equatorial countercurrent. Continental shelves are classified as western or eastern boundaries via coast-normal BFS, producing subtropical gyres (CW in NH, CCW in SH) with western boundary intensification (Gulf Stream, Kuroshio effect) and weaker eastern boundary return flow. Detects circumpolar channels for unobstructed eastward currents (Antarctic Circumpolar Current). Currents are colored by heat transport: red = warm poleward flow, blue = cold equatorward flow, black = zonal (neutral). Computed for both summer and winter seasons.
- **Precipitation** — blended dual-model approach: a complex moisture advection simulation is blended with a fast heuristic zonal model (blend weight and all climate constants are tuned against real-Earth Köppen data; see `js/climate-config.js`). The advection model simulates wind-driven moisture transport from coasts with six mechanisms: ITCZ convective uplift, frontal convergence, orographic rain/shadow, lee cyclogenesis, polar-front precipitation, and subtropical high suppression. The heuristic model provides smooth latitude-based patterns (ITCZ wet belt, subtropical dry belt, mid-latitude recovery, polar dryness) modulated by continentality and orographic effects. Blending the two reduces splotchiness while preserving terrain-informed detail and strengthening subtropical desert formation (~20–35°). Visualized on a brown (dry) → green (moderate) → blue (wet) color ramp. Computed for both summer and winter seasons.
- **Map type switcher** — first-class Terrain / Satellite / Climate / Heightmap tabs with color legends for each view
- **On-demand climate** — optional deferred climate computation; skip climate during generation for faster terrain iteration, compute it on demand when needed
- **Detailed visualization** — dozens of selectable inspection layers organized by category (Geology, Regional Geology, Metal Potential, Atmosphere, Ocean, Climate, Hydrology, Elevation) for viewing each component in isolation. Wind/pressure layers show directional wind arrows, ocean current layers show current arrows colored by heat transport, on both globe and map views. Hydrology layers show seasonal flow accumulation, major river paths, seasonal river dominance, and lake candidates. Regional geology infers broad lithology, crustal and surface ages, intrusions, metamorphism, and sediment thickness; metallogenic layers estimate seven deposit-setting favorabilities, including drainage-routed placer potential.
- **Heightmap import** — bring your own equirectangular B&W heightmap (Earth, Mars, hand-drawn maps) onto a 3D globe. Black pixels become ocean, brighter pixels become higher land. The import page (`/import`) runs full climate simulation (wind, precipitation, temperature, K&ouml;ppen) on your imported terrain, with optional terrain sculpting (smoothing, erosion, ridge sharpening). Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP.
- **Map and data export** — download any available Inspect layer as a high-resolution equirectangular PNG at configurable widths up to 65536px. Elevation products include full land-and-ocean height, land-only height, a 16-bit bathymetry raster, and inverse land/ocean masks. Batch exports produce either a curated worldbuilding atlas or every available map type; CSV and JSON exports preserve per-region climate, circulation, elevation, drainage, lake, plate, erosion, regional geology, and metal-favorability values.

## Quick Start

Serve the project with any local HTTP server (required for ES modules):

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or Node.js
npx serve .
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser. No dependencies to install, no build step.

Click **Build New World** to create a new random planet. The button changes color and label based on what you've adjusted:
- **Build New World** (blue) — generates a fresh planet with a new random seed
- **Rebuild** (amber) — re-renders the current planet at a new detail/roughness level without changing continent shapes
- **Regenerate** (red) — creates new tectonic plates when the Plates or Continents slider has changed

### Navigation

A top navigation bar connects the two pages:
- **Generate** (`/`) — procedural planet generation with tectonic plates, erosion, and climate
- **Import** (`/import`) — import your own equirectangular B&W heightmap, view it on a 3D globe, and run climate simulation. Black (0) = ocean, brighter = higher elevation. Supports PNG, JPEG, and WebP.

### Sharing Planets

Every generated planet produces a **planet code** (shown below the Build button) that encodes the random seed, all slider values, and any plate edits. An unedited planet is 21 characters; plate edits (applied via Rebuild) extend the code to include the toggled plates. Older codes (13–18 characters) from previous versions are still supported — missing sliders default to their current default values. To share a planet:

- **Copy** the code with the copy button and send it to someone
- **Load** a code by pasting it into the planet code field and clicking Load (or pressing Enter). The Load button turns blue when a new code is ready to apply.
- **URL sharing** — the code is also stored in the URL hash (e.g. `#a7f3kq9xp2b`), so you can share the full URL directly. Opening a URL with a valid hash auto-loads that planet, including any plate edits.

## Controls

### Shape Your World

Core world parameters that control the planet's structure (changing these requires a full rebuild):

| Control | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Detail | 5,000 – 2,560,000 | 204,000 | Number of Voronoi cells on the sphere. Only affects rendering resolution — continent shapes are stable across detail levels (generated on a fixed ~20K reference grid) |
| Irregularity | 0 – 1 | 0.75 | Randomization of Fibonacci point positions |
| Plates | 4 – 120 | 80 | Number of tectonic plates |
| Continents | 1 – 10 | 4 | Target number of separate landmasses |
| Roughness | 0 – 0.5 | 0.40 | Fractal noise magnitude for terrain roughness |
| Continent Size Variety | 0 – 1 | 0.35 | How much continent sizes vary — 0 keeps continents similar in size, 1 allows a mix of large and small landmasses |
| Land Coverage | 0 – 1 | 0.3 | Percentage of the planet covered by land. Low values create ocean worlds, high values create desert worlds. Above 40% coverage, precipitation is progressively dampened to simulate reduced oceanic moisture |

### Terrain Sculpting

Post-processing passes that refine the terrain (collapsed by default — the defaults produce good results). These do not require a full rebuild; adjusting any slider lights up the **Reapply** button at the bottom of this section — click it to reapply only the sculpting passes on the current planet.

| Control | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Terrain Warp | 0 – 1 | 0.75 | Domain warping — deforms the elevation field using noise to produce organic, squiggly coastlines and mountain ridges |
| Smoothing | 0 – 1 | 0.10 | Blends harsh terrain boundaries from tectonic generation |
| Glacial Erosion | 0 – 1 | 0.50 | Ice-age sculpting — carves fjords, U-shaped valleys, and lake basins at high latitudes and altitudes via latitude-driven ice flow |
| Hydraulic Erosion | 0 – 1 | 0.50 | Iterative stream-power erosion — resolves endorheic basins via priority-flood canyon carving, then carves river valleys and dendritic drainage networks, with automatic sediment deposition in flat receivers |
| Thermal Erosion | 0 – 1 | 0.10 | Slope-driven material transport — softens ridges and creates natural talus slopes |
| Ridge Sharpening | 0 – 1 | 0.50 | Accentuates mountain ridgelines — pushes peaks further above their surroundings for more dramatic terrain |

### Climate

Global climate offsets that adjust temperature and precipitation without a full rebuild. Changing these triggers a fast climate-only recompute.

| Control | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Temperature | -15 – 15 | 0 | Global temperature offset in °C — positive makes the planet warmer, negative colder. Climate zones shift accordingly |
| Precipitation | -1 – 1 | 0 | Global precipitation scale — positive makes the planet wetter, negative drier. Affects desert and rainforest distribution |

### Auto Climate

Climate simulation (wind, ocean currents, precipitation, temperature, Köppen classification) runs automatically during generation when detail is ≤ 300K regions. Above 300K, climate is skipped for faster terrain iteration and computed on demand when switching to a climate-dependent view.

### Visual Options

- **Map Type** — segmented Terrain / Satellite / Climate / Heightmap tabs for quick switching between the four most common visualizations. Each tab shows a color legend:
  - **Terrain** — elevation color ramp from deep ocean through sea level to mountain peaks
  - **Satellite** — realistic biome colors based on Köppen climate classification and elevation (lush green rainforests, tan deserts, white ice caps, dark taiga, gray tundra), with ocean using the standard terrain palette. High elevations blend toward snow white based on climate-aware snow lines.
  - **Climate** — Köppen-Geiger classification with color swatches for all 30 climate types
  - **Heightmap** — black-to-white gradient on a fixed absolute scale (-10 km ocean floor to 6 km peaks), so the same physical height always maps to the same shade
- **View** dropdown — switch between Globe and Map (equirectangular projection)
- **Center Longitude** slider (map mode only) — shifts the map projection's central meridian to any longitude from 180°W to 180°E, scrolling the equirectangular projection so the chosen longitude is centered. Exports are unaffected (always centered on 0°).
- **Wireframe** — toggle switch to show Voronoi cell edges as a wireframe overlay
- **Show Plates** — toggle switch to color regions by plate (green shades = land, blue shades = ocean); also draws black super plate boundary lines showing tectonic super-groups
- **Auto-Rotate** — toggle switch to spin the globe continuously
- **Grid Lines** — toggle switch for latitude/longitude grid overlay on both globe and map views
- **Grid Spacing** — choose the interval between grid lines: 30°, 15°, 10°, 5°, or 2.5°
- **Measurement Tools** — activate Measure and choose Line to pin a two-point great-circle distance, or Polygonal Area to outline a region with three or more points. Area previews begin at the third point; Finish Area (or Enter) closes the polygon automatically and reports its spherical surface area. Measurements remain aligned when switching between globe, map, and Inspect layers; choose kilometres, miles, or both, then undo or clear pins as needed. Pins are saved locally per planet code. Export Transparent Overlay creates a matching 2:1 PNG at 2048, 4096, or 8192 pixels wide for use over atlas layers in Wonderdraft or an image editor.

### Inspect Dropdown

The **Inspect** dropdown (in Visual Options, below the map tabs) selects a detailed visualization layer. Options are organized into groups:

- **Main views** (ungrouped at top) — Terrain, Satellite, Köppen Climate, Land Heightmap
- **Geology** — Base, Tectonic, Noise, Interior, Coastal, Ocean Floor, Hotspot, Tectonic Activity, Margins, Back-Arc, Fold Ridge, Orogenic Power, Erosion Delta (blue = eroded, red = deposited)
- **Regional Geology** — Surface Lithology, Basement Age, Surface Unit Age, Intrusive Bodies, Metamorphic Grade, and Sediment Thickness. These are deterministic regional inferences from the generated tectonic history, not a full stratigraphic simulation.
- **Metal Potential** — Dominant Metal Province plus Arc/Felsic Hydrothermal, Orogenic Veins, VMS/Base Metals, Mafic Magmatic, Craton-Related, Sedimentary/Residual, and Placer/Alluvial favorability. Legends and data exports list likely associated resources, covering common worldbuilding metals such as iron, copper, tin, silver, lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, aluminum, tungsten, and gold. These identify broad deposit-forming environments, not mine sites or ore grades.
- **Atmosphere** — Pressure Summer/Winter (blue = low, red = high), Wind Speed Summer/Winter (with directional arrows on both globe and map)
- **Ocean** — Currents Summer/Winter (red = warm poleward, blue = cold equatorward, black = zonal; with directional current arrows)
- **Climate** — Precipitation Summer/Winter (brown = dry, green = moderate, blue = wet), Rain Shadow Summer/Winter (diverging blue = windward orographic boost, gray = neutral, red-brown = leeward rain shadow; leeward effects are seeded at downslope faces scaled by mountain height, then propagated ~1500 km downwind to show extended shadow zones like the foehn drying effect), Temperature Summer/Winter (purple-blue = cold, white = 0 C, green-yellow = warm, red = hot; fixed -45 to +45 C range), Continentality (blue = ocean, green = coast, yellow = moderate interior, orange/red = deep continental interior)
- **Terrain Analysis** — Topographic Relief combines fixed metre-based elevation bands, regional hillshade, 500 m contours, and major summits. Elevation Bands isolates physical altitude; Regional Steepness reports broad gradient in metres per kilometre; Local Relief measures the highest-to-lowest land within an approximately 200 km neighborhood; Major Peaks ranks up to 50 separated regional summits. Hover a terrain legend category to isolate it on the map. Elevated plateaus are land at least 1,000 m high with under 500 m of local relief and under 25 m/km regional gradient. These describe continental-to-regional terrain, not survey-scale local topography.
- **Elevation** — Full Heightmap (full-range B&W)

### Export

Click **Export Map** (below Visual Options) to open the export modal:

- **Type** — choose any available core, elevation, mask, geology, metal-potential, atmosphere, ocean, climate, or plate-physics layer. Climate is computed on demand when the selected layer needs it.
- **Width** slider — 1024 to 65536 pixels (height is always width/2 for equirectangular). Large exports use tiled rendering to handle GPU texture limits.
- **Export Selected** — downloads the selected type as an equirectangular PNG with no grid overlay. Wind, pressure, and current maps retain their direction arrows.
- **Worldbuilding Atlas** — downloads the principal terrain, tectonic, regional-geology, metal-potential, elevation, mask, seasonal weather, ocean-current, climate, hydrology, and erosion maps.
- **All Map Types** — downloads every map backed by the current generated or imported world.
- **Data CSV + JSON** — downloads one CSV row per mesh region plus a metadata file documenting units, approximations, coordinate conventions, and 16-bit elevation encodings.
- **Measurement overlay** — the ruler panel exports pinned distance lines and polygonal areas as a transparent equirectangular PNG. Its selected width should match the atlas export width for pixel-perfect overlay alignment.
- **Bathymetry encoding** — ocean pixels 0–65534 map linearly from -10000 m to 0 m; 65535 is reserved for land/no-data. The full heightmap maps 0–65535 from -10000 m to +6000 m.
- A progress overlay shows rendering and PNG encoding status during export

### Sidebar & Loading

The control panel can be collapsed and expanded with the **«** toggle button in the sidebar header. On small screens (≤ 768px) the sidebar becomes a bottom sheet with a drag handle — starts collapsed, showing only the handle and header. Drag up or tap the handle to expand. A fullscreen overlay with spinner, title, and progress bar appears during every generation — fully opaque on initial load, semi-transparent on subsequent builds so the previous planet is dimmed behind it. Stage labels (shaping, plates, oceans, mountains, painting) update as the pipeline progresses.

### Tutorial & Help

A five-step tutorial modal introduces the tool on first visit (auto-shown via `localStorage`). It covers planet generation, slider controls, interactive editing, visualization, saving/sharing via planet codes, and map export. A **?** help button in the top-right corner reopens the tutorial at any time. The modal can be dismissed with the close button, backdrop click, Escape key, or the "Get Started" button on the final step.

A **What's New** modal is shown once per release to returning users (those who have already dismissed the tutorial). It highlights new features, changes, and a heads-up that saved planet codes may produce different-looking worlds due to terrain/climate reworks. The modal uses a versioned `localStorage` flag (`wo-whatsnew-seen`) — bump the `VERSION` constant in `initWhatsNew()` to trigger it again on the next release.

### Interaction

Navigation hints are shown in the sidebar panel and as a contextual tooltip when hovering the planet.

| Action | Desktop | Mobile |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Rotate globe / pan map | Drag | Drag (one finger) |
| Zoom | Scroll wheel | Pinch with two fingers |
| Highlight plate + info card | Hover | — |
| Mark plate for reshaping | Ctrl-click a plate (multi-select) | Tap the edit button (pencil), then tap plates |
| Undo pending plate | Ctrl-click the same plate again | Tap the same plate again |
| Apply pending edits | Click the Rebuild button | Tap the Rebuild button |
| Cancel all pending edits | Press Escape | — |

Hovering over a region shows an info card with plate type, elevation, coordinates, and (when climate has been computed) temperature, precipitation, and K&ouml;ppen classification. Pending plates show a colored tint (green = ocean→land, blue = land→ocean) and hover text indicates "(pending)".

### Mobile Support

World Orogen is fully usable on phones and tablets:

- **Bottom-sheet sidebar** — on screens 768px or narrower, the sidebar becomes a bottom sheet with a drag handle. Drag or tap the handle to expand/collapse. The globe stays visible above.
- **Pinch-to-zoom** — two-finger pinch zooms the globe and map, using the same smooth lerp as desktop scroll-zoom.
- **View switcher** — a dropdown in the top-right lets you switch between Terrain, Satellite, Climate, and Heightmap views without opening the bottom sheet.
- **Edit-mode toggle** — a floating pencil button (bottom-right) activates plate editing. Tap it to toggle edit mode (glows green when active), then tap plates to mark them. Tap the Rebuild button to apply all changes at once.
- **Touch-friendly targets** — buttons, checkboxes, and sliders are enlarged for comfortable finger input.
- **Performance** — detail warning thresholds are lowered on touch devices (orange at 200K, red at 500K). Export widths above 8192px are disabled on mobile.
- **Tooltips** reposition above their trigger instead of to the right, so they stay on screen.
- **Orientation** changes are handled automatically.

## How It Works

### Pipeline

1. **Fibonacci spiral** distributes N points evenly on a unit sphere with optional jitter
2. **Stereographic projection** maps the sphere points to 2D
3. **Delaunator** computes Delaunay triangulation in projected space
4. **Pole closure** connects convex hull edges to a pole point, creating a watertight mesh
5. **Coarse plate generation** on a fixed ~20,000-region reference mesh (resolution-independent), via farthest-point seed placement (with top-3 jitter for variety), round-robin flood fill with per-plate growth rates, directional bias coupled inversely to growth rate, growth-rate governor, and compactness penalty
6. **Ocean/land assignment** on the coarse mesh using farthest-point continent seeding with area budgeting
7. **Plate projection** maps coarse plate assignments onto the high-res mesh via nearest-neighbor adjacency walk, then smooths boundaries with resolution-scaled majority-vote passes
8. **Collision detection** simulates plate drift to classify convergent/divergent/transform boundaries
9. **Stress propagation** diffuses collision stress inward through continental plates via frontier BFS
10. **Elevation assignment** combines distance fields, stress-driven uplift, ocean floor profiles, rift valleys, back-arc basins, hotspot volcanism, island arcs, coastal roughening, and multi-layered noise
11. **Terrain post-processing** applies domain warping (controlled by Terrain Warp slider) using FBM simplex noise to deform the elevation field for organic coastlines and mountain ridges via greedy mesh walk, then bilateral smoothing (controlled by Smoothing slider) to blend BFS banding artefacts, two always-on detail-noise passes add domain-warped high-octave FBM relief to land cells (in physical km space, with Newton-Raphson inversion of the elev→km quartic) to break up flat continental interiors before erosion routes drainage through them — Layer 1 adds 0–100 m positive bumps for broad rolling variety, then Layer 2 adds ±50 m bipolar bumps at 2× frequency and 2× warp amplitude with magnitude biased toward the extremes for sharper finer-scale relief; both layers are dampened by 50 % at full craton/basin weight so geologically quiet regions stay characteristically subdued, and both are scaled by the orogenic-power field so noise relief tracks active mountain-building zones and quiets down over tectonically inactive crust, glacial erosion (controlled by Glacial Erosion slider) carves fjords, U-shaped valleys, and lake basins at high latitudes and altitudes, priority-flood pit resolution carves canyons through mountain saddle points to ensure all land drains to the ocean, iterative implicit stream power hydraulic erosion with sediment deposition (controlled by Hydraulic Erosion slider) carves self-reinforcing river valleys, thermal erosion (controlled by Thermal Erosion slider) softens ridges via talus-angle material transport, ridge sharpening (controlled by Ridge Sharpening slider) accentuates mountain ridgelines, and always-on soil creep gently rounds off hillslopes
12. **Wind simulation** computes a longitude-varying ITCZ by scanning for the thermal maximum at each longitude (accounting for land/sea heating differential and elevation lapse rate), builds pressure fields from Gaussian zonal bands centered on the ITCZ plus land/sea thermal modifiers and elevation barometric effects, then derives wind vectors from pressure gradients with latitude-dependent Coriolis deflection and surface friction. Computed for both NH summer and winter.
13. **Ocean currents** uses a rule-based geographic approach: classifies ocean cells by wind belt (trades, westerlies, polar easterlies) to set base zonal flow, runs three BFS passes from coastal seeds to compute distance to western and eastern coastlines (classified by coast-normal direction), deflects currents poleward near western boundaries (warm, intensified ×2) and equatorward near eastern boundaries (cold, weaker ×0.8), detects circumpolar channels at ±60° latitude for unobstructed eastward flow, smooths with 5 Laplacian passes, and classifies heat transport by meridional flow direction. Computed for both seasons.
14. **Precipitation** uses a blended dual-model approach. The complex model computes moisture advection from coasts using iterative upwind propagation driven by wind vectors, with depletion based on distance and elevation gain, plus six mechanisms: ITCZ convective uplift, frontal convergence at subpolar lows, orographic rain/rain shadow, lee cyclogenesis, polar front diffuse precipitation, and seasonal subtropical high suppression (shifts poleward in local summer to create Mediterranean dry-summer patterns). A heuristic zonal model computes smooth precipitation from ITCZ distance (with aggressive subtropical drying at 15–30°), seasonal hemisphere boost with Mediterranean subtropical suppression (up to 55% summer reduction at 25-42° latitude), continental dryness, and orographic rain shadow. The two models are blended (weight in `js/climate-config.js`, tuned against real-Earth Köppen zones) then normalized via 95th-percentile scaling. Computed for both seasons.
15. **Temperature** computes per-cell surface temperature using the ITCZ as the thermal equator (~28°C peak, warmest latitude band), with poleward cooling following a power-law curve with a tropical plateau. Modulated by a zone×latitude seasonal swing table with a slight winter-heavy asymmetry, moisture-dependent elevation lapse rate (moist to dry adiabatic, interpolated by precipitation), ocean current warmth diffused onto coastal land, and precipitation/cloud cover moderation. All constants live in `js/climate-config.js` and are auto-tuned against real-Earth Köppen zones (see `tuning/climate/`). Normalized to a fixed -45 to +45 C range. Computed for both seasons.
16. **Hydrology** conditions terrain depressions, routes every land cell toward an outlet, accumulates seasonal precipitation, and identifies major river paths, seasonality, catchments, and lake candidates.
17. **Regional geology** combines craton, basin, fold-belt, stress, margin, hotspot, flood-basalt, mantle, erosion, climate, and drainage fields into broad lithology, age, intrusive, metamorphic, sediment, and metallogenic-favorability layers. Oceanic basement age is approximated from distance to spreading ridges; placer sources are accumulated through the hydrology graph.
18. **Rendering** builds a Voronoi cell mesh with per-vertex colors and terrain displacement
